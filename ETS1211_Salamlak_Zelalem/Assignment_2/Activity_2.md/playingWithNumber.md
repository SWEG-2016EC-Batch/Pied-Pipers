## **QUESTION**
Write a program that accepts an integer from the user and perform the following. Once
you complete solving all the exercises compile it and prepare a menu.</br>
a) Prints the reverses of the number (e.g. input = 4637215 Output=5217364).</br>
b) Counts the number of digits in a given number (e.g. 23,498 has five digits)</br>
c) Find the product of even digits of the a given number (e.g. input=4,923 prod=8)</br>
d) Prints the first and the last digit of the number and find their sum.</br>
e) Swap the first and the last digit of the number.</br>
g) Check whether a number is palindrome or not.</br>
h) Find the frequency of each digit in a given integer and print in table format.</br>
i) Check if a number is Strong or not.</br>
[Hint]: A Strong number is a number, where the sum of the factorial of the digits is equal to the
number itself.</br>
j) Check whether a number is Perfect number or not.</br>
[Hint]: A Perfect Number is an integer where the sum of its divisors minus the number itself
equals the number.</br>
