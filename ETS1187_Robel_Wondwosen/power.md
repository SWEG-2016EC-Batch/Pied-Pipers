# Problem Analysis and Algorithm design for Power Calculator




## Problem Analysis:
### Input
1. x
2. y

### Output
x the power of y.

### Calculation: 
  To find out x the power of y, multiply x by itself y times.


## Algorithm:
1. Start
2. Declare variables for x and y.
3. Prompt the user to input x.
4. Read and store the input value in x.
5. Prompt the user to input y.
6. Read and store the input value in y.
7. Calculate x the power of y by multiplying x by itself, y times.
8. Store the result in the variable power.
9. Output the value of power.
10. End
