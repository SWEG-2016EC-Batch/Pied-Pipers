1, Make a program that calculates the Body Mass Index (BMI) of a person and determine weather the person is in normal weight, under weight or over weight. BMI is calculated as (BMI = w/h*h). Make the program to work for multiple person before terminated.
 
  input- weight, height, number
  output- BMI
   
    step 1- start
    step 2- read weight in kilogram and height in meters
    step 3- calculate BMI as weight/(height*height)
    step 4- check if BMI is greater than or equal to 19 and lessthan or equal to 25 
            4.1- if BMI is greaterthan or equal to 19 and lessthan or equal to 25 ,it is normal weight
          4.2- if it isn't greaterthan or equal to 19 and lessthan or equal to 25 , goto step 5
    step 5- check if BMI is greater              than 25 
            5.1- if BMI is greaterthan 25 it is overweight 
            5.2- if BMI isn't greaterthan 25 goto step 6
   step 6- check if BMI is lessthan 19
          6.1- if it is lessthan 19, it is underweight 
    step 7- print BMI
    step 8- check if the  number is zero or non-zero.
         8.1- if the number is zero terminate the program.
         8.2- if the number is non-zero  to execute the program 
   step 9- stop
