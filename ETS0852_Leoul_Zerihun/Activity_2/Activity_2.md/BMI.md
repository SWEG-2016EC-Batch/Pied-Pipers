Make a program that calculates the Body Mass Index (BMI) of a person and determine weather the person is in normal weight, under weight or over weight. BMI is calculated as (BMI = w/h*h). Make the program to work for multiple person before terminated.

The problem needs weight and height as an input. The output will be BMI.

The algorithm would be: 
step 1- start
step 2- Read weight in kilograms and height in meters
step 3- calculate BMI as weight/(height*height)
step 4- check if BMI is greaterthan or equal to 19 and lessthan or equal to 25 
    4.1- if BMI is greaterthan or equal to 19 and lessthan or equal to 25 ,it is normal weight
    4.2- if it isn't greaterthan or equal to 19 and lessthan or equal to 25 , goto step 5
step 5- check if BMI is greaterthan 25 
    5.1- if BMI is greaterthan 25 it is overweight 
    5.2- if BMI isn't greaterthan 25 goto step 6
step 6- check if BMI is lessthan 19
    6.1- if it is lessthan 19,it is underweight  
step 7- print BMI
Step 8- read a number 
Step 9- check if the  number is zero or non-zero.
    9.1- if the number is zero, goto step 10
    9.2- if the number is  non-zero, goto step 2
   step 10- stop
