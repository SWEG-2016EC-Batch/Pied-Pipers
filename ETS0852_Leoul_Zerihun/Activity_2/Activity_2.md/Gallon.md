# Problem Statement
The program calculates the number of miles an automobile can be driven without refueling, given the fuel tank capacity and miles per gallon (MPG).
## Problem analysis 
* The user should enter both the capacity of the automobile fuel tank (in gallons) and the miles per gallon (MPG) the automobile can drive.

* The output will be the total number of miles the automobile can be driven without refueling.

## Steps

1. **Start**

2. **Accept inputs**:
   - The capacity of the automobile fuel tank (in gallons).
   - The miles per gallon (MPG) the automobile can drive.

3. **Check the inputs**:

    3.1. If the inputs are valid (greater than zero), proceed to step 4.

    3.2. If the inputs are invalid (less than zero or non-numeric ), print "Invalid input" and go to step 6.

5. **Calculate the total miles** as the product of tank capacity by the miles per gallon.

6. **Print** the total number of miles the automobile can be driven without refueling.

7. **Stop**
