 Write a program that prompts the capacity in gallons of an automobile fuel tank and the miles per gallons
the automobiles can be driven. The program outputs the number of miles the automobile can be driven
without refuelling. 

 The problem requires two inputs, the capacity in gallons of an automobile fuel tank and the miles per gallons, the automobile can be driven. The output will be the number of miles the automobile can be driven 

The algorithm would be:

step 1 - Start
step 2 - Accept the capacity of an automobile fuel tank and the miles per gallons the automobile can be driven.
step 3 - Check the validity of the input
    3.1 - If it is valid, go to step 4
    3.2 - If it is invalid (if the inputs are lessthan zero or characters or symbols), print invalid input and goto step 6
step 4 - Calculate the number of miles the automobile can be driven as the product of gallon by miles per gallon 
step 5 - Print the number of miles the automobile can be driven without refuelling
step 6 - Stop
