A serial transmission line can transmit 960 characters a second. Write a program that will calculate how long 
it will take to send a file, given the file size. 

The problem needs file size as an input. The output will be the time it takes for a file to be transferred.

The algorithm would be:

step 1 - Start
step 2 - Read the file size 
step 3 - calculate how long does the file transfer takes as the product of the  time it takes per character and the file size.
step 4 - print the time 
step 5 - stop
