# Problem Statement
The program calculates the result of  x raised to the power of y 
## Problem analysis 
* The user enters the value of x and y.

* The output will be x raised to the power of y .
## Steps

1. **Start**

2. **Accept inputs**:
   - Accept the values of x and y.

3. **Check the inputs**:

    3.1. If both inputs are valid (numeric and not zero for both x and y at the same time), proceed to Step 4.

    3.2. If the inputs are invalid (both x and y are zero or inputs are characters or symbols), print "Invalid input" and go to Step 6.

5. **Calculate x raised to the power of y** as the multiplication of x by itself y times

6. **Print** the value of x raised to the power of y .

7. **Stop**
