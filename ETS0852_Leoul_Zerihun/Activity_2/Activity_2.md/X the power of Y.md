 Write a program that finds the result of the expression x the power of y 

 The problem requires the value of x and y to be entered by the user.

 The algorithm would be:

Step 1 - Start 
Step 2 - Read the value of x and y 
Step 3 - checks the validity of the input
    3.1 - if it is valid, goto Step 4
    3.2 - if it is invalid, goto step 6
Step 4 - Calculate x the power of y as the product of x y times.
Step 5 - print x the power of y 
Step 6 - Stop
