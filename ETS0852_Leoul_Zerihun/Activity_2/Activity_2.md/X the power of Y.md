 Write a program that finds the result of x the power of y 

 The problem requires the value of x and y to be entered by the user.

 The algorithm would be:

Step 1 - Start

Step 2 - Accept the value of x and y 

Step 3 - Check the validity of the input 
   
    3.1 - If it is valid, goto Step 4
  
    3.2 - If it is invalid ( if both inputs are zero or characters or symbol), print invalid input and goto Step 6

Step 4 - Calculate x the power of y as the product of x , y times.

Step 5 - Print x the power of y 

Step 6 - Stop
