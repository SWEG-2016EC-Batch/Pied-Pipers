/ Write a program that find the result of the expression x the power of y where the value of X and Y are entered by the user.

/ The problem needs the value of x and y to be entered by the user.

/ The algorithm would be:

Step 1 - Start 
Step 2 - Read the value of x and y 
Step 3 - Calculate x the power of y as the product of x y times.
step 4 - print x the power of y 
step 5 - stop
