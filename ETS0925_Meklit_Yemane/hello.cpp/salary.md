# Problem Analysis and Algorithm design for Salary Calculator

## Problem Analysis

### Input

1.Employee name

2.Weekly working hours

3.Bonus rate per hour

4.Base salary

### Output

1.Employee's name

2.Gross salary

3.Net salary

4.Bonus payment

### Calculation

Bonus Payment: bonus_payment = weekly_working_hours * bonus_rate_per_hour

Gross Salary: gross_salary = base_salary + bonus_payment

### Algorithm

1.Start

2.Declare variables for name, weekly_working_hours, bonus_rate_per_hour, base_salary, bonus_payment, gross_salary, pension_deduction, tax_deduction, and net_salary.

3.Prompt the user to input the employee's name and store the input in name.

4.Prompt the user to input the weekly working hours and store the input in weekly_working_hours.

5.Prompt the user to input the bonus rate per hour and store the input in bonus_rate_per_hour.

6.Prompt the user to input the base salary and store the input in base_salary.

7.Calculate the bonus payment using the formula: bonus_payment = weekly_working_hours * bonus_rate_per_hour.

8.Calculate the gross salary using the formula: gross_salary = base_salary + bonus_payment.

9.Calculate the pension deduction using the formula: pension_deduction = gross_salary * 0.05.

10.Calculate the tax deduction using the formula: tax_deduction = gross_salary * 0.15.

11.Calculate the net salary using the formula: net_salary = gross_salary - pension_deduction - tax_deduction.

12.Output the employee's name, gross salary, bonus payment, and net salary.

13.End
